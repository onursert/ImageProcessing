# ImageProcessing
<p>Image Processing Project - 2021 (Python)</p>

<p>The project is about developing a few image processes. In project Python language as a programming language, Scikit-Image and OpenCV for image processing, Tkinter library for interface creation, and Jupyter as environment were preferred.</p>

</p>Various manipulating and editing processes were made on the images in the project. These are; image loading and saving, interface/form environment (Tkinter), 10 image enhancement processes and filters (hessian, laplace, meijering, roberts, sato, sobel, unsharp_mask, threshold_li, threshold_otsu, threshold_yen), histogram display and equalization, 5 spatial transformation operations (resize, rotate, rescale, swirl, integral_image), user-value density conversion operations, 10 morphological operations (convex_hull_image, area_closing, binary_closing, black_tophat, dilation, erosion, local_maxima, local_minima, watershed, white_tophat), active contour example (with description), an Instagram dog filter as a Social Media filter, and the process of converting the picture to pastel tones, and face and eye detection with OpenCV in the video processing step.</p>
